## Viewing content in your browser

You need to run `jekyll serve` and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4000` to view your working branch in your browser otherwise your content may not load properly.

In order to run jekyll you must create a file containing the text "ruby-[ruby-version]" where "ruby-version" is the version of ruby you wish to use (e.g. "2.1.2"). Save the file as ".ruby-version" in the root directory. Once you've saved this file `cd` into your project's root directoy (`cd ..` out of the directory and `cd` into it if you're already there). You should now be able to type `jekyll serve` and run a local server. Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4000` or whatever terminal says your server address to see a live preview of your current branch in the browser.
