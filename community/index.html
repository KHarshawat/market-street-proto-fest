  The Market Street community is rich and diverse, encompassing all who live, work, recreate, visit or do business on Market Street. It also includes individuals and organizations located nearby whose lives and livelihoods are intertwined with the activities on Market Street, as well as the thousands each day who traverse the street on their way to other destinations. 
  <br><br>If you care about Market Street and the future of San Francisco, join us!
	<br><br><strong>Community Input to Date</strong>
	<br>Market Street constituents have been engaged in conversations about the future of Market Street for  the past several years through the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org" target="_blank">Better Market Street</a> initiative, a planning collaboration involving several city departments. Throughout this process, the public has voiced the strong desire for a vibrant public realm on the sidewalks of Market Street, which gave birth to the  City’s proposal to create extra wide sidewalks animated as “street life zones.” This, in turn, catalyzed the idea of this festival and the specific design goals listed in the Open Call.

	<br><br><strong>Community Input to Come</strong>
	<br>We are committed to continuing this dialogue by cultivating a rich and ongoing conversation between Festival organizers, prototype designers and community members. Here are just a few of the ways you can make sure your voice is heard and ensure that the prototypes address  the needs and desires of your community.
	<br><br><ul>
		<li>Provide insights about your community, prototype ideas and other suggestions via our website
		<li>Come to our public events to share thoughts, learn more, and meet collaborators
		<li>Respond to the Open Call by June 27 to work on a design team
		<li>Share your thoughts with the selected design teams at public engagement events this summer 
		<li>Test-drive prototypes at the Festival and give feedback
 	</ul>
	<br><strong>Resources</strong>
	<br>We will be growing this page into a resource for community members about how they  can get involved and designers for how they can learn about and engage with the Market Street community. Check back for more soon!
	<hr>
	<p>The City's Better Market Street project breaks Market down into five Zones.<br><br> For the Festival, each of these Zones will have a <strong>Zone Captain</strong> to guide the project teams working there through
  their work. You can learn more about each Zone and its Captain below.

   		<br>The civic heart of the City, this district is known for its statuesque landmarks and destinations including the Civic Center, United Nations Plaza, the San Francisco Main Library, the Federal Building, and the various arts/cultural destinations that exist around the Civic Center on and off Market Street. <br><br>With new, luxury residential condos and office complexes for tech companies joining the mix of lower income and homeless residents, this district is defined by flux and a growing concern by many about gentrification.

At the same time tech and other successful companies are moving in, the neighboring Tenderloin is rich with immigrant culture as well as the youngest and poorest populations of the city.

edge back to the city.<br><br>The tall commercial buildings of the Financial District give way
to plazas, parks and urban recreation along the waterfront,  inviting tourists and locals alike to experience the bustling Ferry Building, which opened in 1898 as the wooden Ferry House,  the focal point for anyone arriving by train from the East, or workers coming to the city by ferry from Marin or the East Bay. Today the ferry building is not only a transportation hub,  but is a farm-to-table, and made-in-San Francisco marketplace.
