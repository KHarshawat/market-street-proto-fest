The PPlanter is a rapidly deployable, reconfigurable public urinal and sink that uses modular biofilters to treat urine and wastewater. A network of sensors for automated monitoring and a responsive web application enable public feedback and participation in the design of future iterations. The project is one in a toolbox of rapidly deployable urban green infrastructure prototypes designed by the Hyphae Design Laboratory in collaboration with the non-profit Urban Biofilter.

Transform your street, neighborhood, or city! Make public urination more positive!
