The idea of the project “Highlights: is to really transform dark public spaces (or alleyways) into usable space at night through thoughtful video/mapping projections.

It could also be a very educational approach, i.e. transforming the alley into a native redwood forest and projecting native flora and fauna, or something that is historically or culturally significant to the alley like the mural that we had done.

Overall goal is to revitalize these urban voids for people to walk through at night and feel safe. It’s an idea that could be used in any urban environment scale: city, state, country-  as every built-up environment has these dark spaces between buildings. It could be a way to really revitalize an area and introduce people, business, and culture into a space that is perceived negatively.
