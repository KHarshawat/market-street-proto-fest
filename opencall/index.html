			<h3>The Festival: October 2 - 4, 2014</h3>

			As part of the City’s official planning process for Market Street, the Festival will bring exceptional ideas to life as prototypes that can be developed into long-term fixtures of city streets.  Hundreds of thousands of people along Market Street will engage with public design installations and give direct feedback to project teams and the City.

			<h3>Open Call for Proposals: May 12 - June 27, 2014</h3>

			We are accepting proposals for prototypes that bring Market Street’s sidewalks to life. 

			In June our jury will select up to 50 of the submitted projects to present at the Festival on Market Street in October 2014. 

			<br><br>Selected project teams will: 
			<ul>
				<li>receive a $2,000 stipend - $1K at the beginning, $1K upon completion</li>
				<li>have access to the machines and tools needed to build their projects</li>
				<li>work directly with global design leaders in San Francisco</li>
				<li>interact with local communities to refine their visions</li>
				<li>have a platform to share and scale their projects in cities around the world</li>
			</ul>
			<br>After the Festival, the City will work to make the most successful projects part of the Better Market Street redesign in 2017.  

			<h3>Community Context</h3>

			Designing With and For Community: Consider the goals below, read previous Market Street reports, and engage people on the street.

			Over the past several years, the City’s Better Market Street initiative has gathered extensive community feedback; the result, the public wants a more vibrant street life on Market Street.  The City has responded with a commitment to redesigned sidewalks and “Street Life Zones” that make our public space more active and attractive. These are the zones we are asking YOU to reimagine and activate during the Festival. 

			As a placemaking project, the Festival is  driven by community needs and desires - we are looking for project designs that do the same.  Your project’s selection depends on your ability to listen to and  respond to the community’s feedback as well as on the inventiveness of your design and the .

			If you are a selected designer, you will frequently and considerately interact with the community where your project will be installed. The more resilient and responsive your prototype to community needs, the more likely it could be funded/produced as a more permanent installation. Required participation includes attending several Festival-sponsored public engagement activities this summer as well as gathering feedback from those testing  your project during the Festival.


			<h3>What We’re Looking For</h3>  Bold and imaginative projects that create a vibrant public space along Market Street.

			We are looking for projects that encourage activity where people linger, socialize and spend time. We also want projects that identify Market Street as uniquely San Francisco, creating an experience of the city’s history, diversity, environmental commitment, and leadership in cultural creativity and technological innovation.

			More specifically, we are seeking projects that address one or more of the goals outlined below. These are suggestions; we invite you to be inventive.
